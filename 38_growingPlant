Each day a plant is growing by upSpeed meters. Each night that plant's height decreases by downSpeed meters due to the lack of sun heat. Initially, plant is 0 meters tall. We plant the seed at the beginning of a day. We want to know when the height of the plant will reach a certain level.

Example

For upSpeed = 100, downSpeed = 10, and desiredHeight = 910, the output should be
growingPlant(upSpeed, downSpeed, desiredHeight) = 10.

/* Solution */
int growingPlant(int upSpeed, int downSpeed, int desiredHeight) {
    int sum = 0;
    int k = 1;
    while( sum < desiredHeight){
        sum+= upSpeed;
        if (sum >= desiredHeight)
            break;
        ++k;
        sum-=downSpeed;        
    }
    return k;
}


/* Solution 2 */

int growingPlant(int upSpeed, int downSpeed, int desiredHeight) {
   return Math.max(0, (int) Math.ceil((double) (desiredHeight - upSpeed) / (upSpeed - downSpeed))) + 1;
}
